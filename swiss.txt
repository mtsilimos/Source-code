Switzerland needs to invest CHF13 billion a year ($14 billion), the equivalent of 2% of gross domestic product (GDP), 
over the next three decades to meet its 2050 carbon-zero goal, a study has found.
External link by the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), published on Thursday, 
calculated that CHF387.2 billion would have to be invested over the next 30 years to meet this objective.
'The bulk of this investment is needed in the sectors of light road traffic, buildings and heavy road traffic,' the report said.
BCG Managing Director Christian Schmid said the required spending would equate to roughly double Switzerland's current military outlays.
